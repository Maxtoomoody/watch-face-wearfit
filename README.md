# watch-face-wearfit
 
 A collection of watch face binary files.

 ## Collection

 - [`dials/D18Max`](dials/D18Max/README.md)
 - [`dials/HW19`](dials/HW19/README.md)
 - [`dials/HW21`](dials/HW21/README.md)
 - [`dials/HW22`](dials/HW22/README.md)
 - [`dials/HW22+`](dials/HW22+/README.md)
 - [`dials/M16mini`](dials/M16mini/README.md)
 - [`dials/mibro_air`](dials/mibro_air/README.md)
 - [`dials/others`](dials/others/README.md)
 - [`dials/X5Pro`](dials/X5Pro/README.md)
 - [`dials/X8Ultra`](dials/X8Ultra/README.md)

## Compatibilities 
- HW22+ and D18Max dials tested and working for HW57 Pro.
- Do not try to install X8Ultra dials in HW57 Pro; this will reboot your watch in loop.

## Installation
 
 They can be installed using Chronos app

> **Warning**
> Install faces at your own risk as they may not be compatible with your watch


## Tools

The latest version of Chronos (v2.4.0) allows you to extract binary watchfaces. When extracting, the watchface resources will be saved as images. If you make any edits to these images, you can then pack them back into a binary watchface.
